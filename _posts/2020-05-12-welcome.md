Hello!

I decided in the depths of my quarantine boredom to start writing more!
While I love squidarth.com and have enjoyed writing blog posts there
the last couple years, I've been treating it as a professional space. I'm hoping to use
this new site as a less professional, more ad-hoc, and hopefully
more fun space.

I'm hoping to use this as a space to publish my half-baked thoughts
and ideas. While most of the content here is going to be programming-related,
I also plan on sharing thoughts on other things, as well as what I've been reading/watching/playing.
I definitely plan on continuing to update squidarth.com, and there are certainly posts
here that will evolve into posts on squidarth.com. The goal here is that while posts
on squidarth.com will continue to be topic-oriented, there will be posts in here
that are just titled with the day's date. Maybe one day I'll consolidate them. Who knows.

Hope you enjoy it!
